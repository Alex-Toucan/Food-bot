# Wut is dis
A useless toast bot! once you get it up and running... just ping it in dms... or, add it to a server and ping it then
## Cool! what do I need?
### Files needed to create
You will need to create a file called .env and add to the file
`TOKEN=YOURDISCORDTOKENWITHOUTSPACES`
### Things I need to make
A discord bot! Just set up a bot... and create the .env using your new token
### Software I need
* Node.js
* NPM
### Packages I need
* discord.js
* request (not needed right now... but I am planning to transition from fetch to request)
* node-fetch
* dotenv-flow
I also HIGHLy reccomend getting the package nodemon. this will automaticly restart the bot each change
For that... instead of `node *` Write `nodemon --inspect index.js`. then sit back and get coden
# How to use the bot
In a server your new bot is in... ping it... or write `Toast` (not case sensitive)
The bot will dm you toast. you can dm the bot Toast and it will do the same thing

Write `About the toast...` and the bot will give you a info blurb

Write `super secret stuff lol` and it will print into the cosole hosting the bot info about the servers its in.

thats really it.

# TODO
* Add more about info
* Add funny toast sounds
* Change the reaction to a custom emoji
* get a life
